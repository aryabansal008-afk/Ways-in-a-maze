# Maze Path Counter

A C program to calculate the total number of possible ways to travel from the start to the end of a maze.  
The program demonstrates the use of **recursion** (and can be extended to **backtracking**) to explore all valid paths.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Calculates total paths from start to destination in a grid-like maze.
- Handles recursive exploration of possible moves.
- Helps in understanding **recursion**, **pathfinding**, and **backtracking concepts**.
- Beginner-friendly code structure in C.

---

## ðŸ§© How It Works
- The maze is represented as a grid with `n` rows and `m` columns.
- You can move **down** or **right** at each step.
- The program recursively explores all possible moves until it reaches the destination.
- The total number of valid paths is then returned.
